# Gridworld

This is an implementation of DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, and A-star search on a world of grid from a starting grid to a goal grid. There is nothing you can do against this AI, but you can follow the instructions and use your mouse and keyboard to change the properity of certain grids (i.e. to build your own gridworld).
